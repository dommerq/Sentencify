Sentencify
==========

Sentencify, create playlists from sentences with Spotify

What is it exactly?
--
As I said, it's an Android app, to create playlist from pure sentences.
Let's say you want to create a playlist with titles named "I love you, this is awesome, thanks". Well, I'm going to do that for you.
You write your sentence, you select the best titles you like and voil√†. Isn't your life simple now? Yes it iiiss. Hum.


Why did I do it?
--
Well, that's simple. One day, @SpotifyCares sent me [a playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares/playlist/6veneBslgZJBRm48SwERhm) (I was asking since when I'm using Spotify)
When I received it, I didn't see the thing. The big thing.

The tracks' names are actually the answer I wanted.
Few months later, it was my Spotify's birthday. I know you figured out [this](http://open.spotify.com/user/spotifycares/playlist/7eeW7hZiJt8gvAGh9yAu27) would happen.

Few months later again, someone quit his job, [using a playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/majorlex/playlist/69HEu8KInrU7uDqdM9Rw6F), I was surprised, and I almost found this nice.

Few months later, again and again, I though I should create an app that does this kind of things. But I didn't (nope, not yet), lack of time I guess.

~~Few months later,~~ Here it is.

Are you going to build this on the web or iOS?
--
Nope, not now. Simply because I'm not a webdev and it would take me too much time to do it.
If you want to, be my guest, just tell me when it's done, so I can use it :D
Oh and, no. I'm not developping this on Bada or similar haha.

How can I contact you?
--
Why would you?
You can ping me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/kentin_dommerc) or maybe you want to [email me](mailto:dommer.q@gmail.com).
Third option, [my linkedin](ie.linkedin.com/in/quentindommerc)

Why is it Android +4.0?
--
Come on. You must be kidding, right? 4.0 is 3 years old. __THREE YEARS OLD__.
